This is a list of C/C++ practice I have been working on. 

The "Basic Programs" folder contains programs that I wrote to learn the C/C++ languaage. 

The "Data Structures and Algorithms" folder contains programs that I have written so I could practice advanced skills I have learned from a Udemy couse I am taking.

I am still learning how to use git more efficiently. I have recently started using SourceTree to manage the local branches more effectively and installed git.
