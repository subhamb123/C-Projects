# C Projects

This is a list of C practice I have been working on. 

The "Basic Programs" folder contains programs that I wrote to learn the C languaage. 

The "Data Structures and Algorithms" folder contains programs that I have written so I could practice advanced skills I have learned from a Udemy couse I am taking.

I am practicing the professional practice of making new branches and not making changes directly on the master branch. I have installed git to do this and use SourceTree to manage my changes.
